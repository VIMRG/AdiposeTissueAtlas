## **Abstract**
Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) is a critical regulator of systemic metabolic homeostasis. Persons with HIV (PWH) have an increased risk of metabolic diseases and have significant alterations in SAT immune cells compared with the general population. We generated a comprehensive SAT atlas from 59 PWH with a spectrum of metabolic diseases to characterize cellular compositional and transcriptional changes associated with glucose intolerance and demographic characteristics. In PWH, glucose intolerance was associated with increased lipid-associated macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T effector memory cells, and decreased perivascular macrophages. We observed a coordinated intercellular regulatory program enriched for genes related to inflammation and lipid-processing with glucose intolerance that was also present in diabetic HIV-negative persons. Finally, CD4+ tissue resident cells were most strongly associated with altered whole tissue expression of genes related to lipid and glucose metabolism. These data provide a comprehensive assessment of SAT immune cells that may contribute to glucose intolerance.
